Ass 1.1
- I'm so fucking grateful for my ass.
- Create sequential baseline (Took 2.09415 seconds
                              Normalized: 2.09415e-09 seconds)
- We can parallelise one time step
    - This means creating threads for each timestep
- Then, we try to avoid destroying threads by using conditional codes and mutexes.
