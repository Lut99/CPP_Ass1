### NOTES POUR LA REPORT ###

Ass 1.1
- I'm so fucking grateful for my ass.
- Create sequential baseline 
    - Results (using 1 extra thread):
        Took 2.09415 seconds
        Normalized: 2.09415e-09 seconds
- We can parallelise one time step
    - This means creating threads for each timestep
    - Results (using 1 extra thread):
        Took 2.38671 seconds
        Normalized: 2.38671e-09 seconds
- Then, we try to avoid destroying threads by using pthread barriers
    - This way we can reuse treads instead of creating and destroying them each timestep
